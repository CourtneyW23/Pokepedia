# Pokepedia

This is a iOS app created on Xcode using Swift language. The purpose of this assignment was to create an app that displayed
information about each Pokemon character using a RESTful API. 

This is a class project for iOS app desgin. I implemented the View Abilities, Some Other, and Details Folders. The rest was boiler plate code provided by my instructor.
